I always think that getting to know the types of Machine learning algorithms is like getting to see the Big Picture of AI
When facing a wide variety of machine learning algorithms, is “which algorithm should I use?” The answer to the question varies depending on many factors, including

The size, quality, and nature of data.
The available computational time.
The urgency of the task.
What you want to do with the data.

The best algorithms might not be the methods that have achieved the highest reported accuracy, as an algorithm usually requires careful tuning and extensive training to obtain its best achievable performance.

Types of machine learning Algorithms
    Supervised learning
    Unsupervised Learning
    Semi-supervised Learning
    Reinforcement Learning

1.Supervised Learning

Supervised Learning Algorithms are the ones that involve direct supervision (cue the title) of the operationIn this case, the developer labels sample data corpus and set strict boundaries upon which the algorithm operates.
In supervised learning, the machine is taught by example. The operator provides the machine learning algorithm with a known dataset that includes desired inputs and outputs, and the algorithm must find a method to determine how to arrive at those inputs and outputs. While the operator knows the correct answers to the problem, the algorithm identifies patterns in data, learns from observations and makes predictions. 
The primary purpose of supervised learning is to scale the scope of data and to make predictions of unavailable, future or unseen data based on labeled sample data.

Supervised machine learning includes two major processes: classification and regression.

Classification is the process where incoming data is labeled based on past data samples and manually trains the algorithm to recognize certain types of objects and categorize them accordingly. The system has to know how to differentiate types of information, perform an optical character, image, or binary recognition (whether a particular bit of data is compliant or non-compliant to specific requirements in a manner of “yes” or “no”).

Regression is the process of identifying patterns and calculating the predictions of continuous outcomes. The system has to understand the numbers, their values, grouping (for example, heights and widths), etc. 


The most widely used supervised algorithms are
Linear Regression
Logistical Regression
Random Forest
Gradient Boosted Trees
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Neural Networks
Decision Trees
Naive Bayes
Nearest Neighbor


2.Unsupervised Learning
Unsupervised Learning is the one that does not involve direct control of the developer Here, the machine learning algorithm studies data to identify patterns. There is no answer key or human operator to provide instruction. Instead, the machine determines the correlations and relationships by analysing available data. In an unsupervised learning process, the machine learning algorithm is left to interpret large data sets and address that data accordingly. The algorithm tries to organise that data in some way to describe its structure. This might mean grouping the data into clusters or arranging it in a way that looks more organised.

As it assesses more data, its ability to make decisions on that data gradually improves and becomes more refined.

Clustering: it is an exploration of data used to segment it into meaningful groups (i.e., clusters) based on their internal patterns without prior knowledge of group credentials. The credentials are defined by the similarity of individual data objects and also aspects of their dissimilarity from the rest (which can also be used to detect anomalies).
Dimensionality reduction: there is a lot of noise in the incoming data. Machine learning algorithms use dimensionality reduction to remove this noise while distilling the relevant information.

The most widely used algorithms are:

k-means clustering
t-SNE (t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding)
PCA (Principal Component Analysis)
Association rule

3.Semi-supervised  Learning 
Semi-supervised learning algorithms represent a middle ground between supervised and unsupervised algorithms.A semi-supervised machine-learning algorithm uses a limited set of labeled sample data to shape the requirements of the operation (i.e., train itself).The limitation results in a partially trained model that later gets the task to label the unlabeled data. Due to the limitations of the sample data set, the results are considered pseudo-labeled data.labeled and pseudo-labeled data sets are combined, which creates a distinct algorithm that combines descriptive and predictive aspects of supervised and unsupervised learning.Semi-supervised learning uses the classification process to identify data assets and the clustering process to group it into distinct parts


4.Reinforcement Machine Learning Algorithms
Reinforcement learning represents what is commonly understood as machine learning artificial intelligence.Reinforced ML uses the technique called exploration/exploitation. The mechanics are simple - the action takes place, the consequences are observed, and the next action considers the results of the first action
Most common reinforcement learning algorithms include:
Q-Learning
Temporal Difference (TD)
Monte-Carlo Tree Search (MCTS)
Asynchronous Actor-Critic Agents (A3C)
